# chaOS - a full-stack operating system for advancing collective intelligence

### Background

Engaging, understanding and empowering different perspectives and varying visions is key to building collaborative, productive and resilient communities over the long term. As scale increases, so does the challenge of maintaining coherance, alignment and knowledge transfer, which in turn leads to challenges with advancing or even sustaining collective intelligence. This leads to upper limits on the effectiveness of a group, the stagnation of once energetic and worthwhile initatives and the inevitable decay of community culture. 

### Coordination systems for culture

Throughout history, social groups have kept records of debts and credits through oral, symbolic, pictoral or numeric ledgers, that have in turn formed the operating system for culture. 

> Culture is an umbrella term which encompasses the social behavior, institutions, and norms found in human societies, as well as the knowledge, beliefs, arts, laws, customs, capabilities, and habits of the individuals in these groups. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture) 

For the last 200 years, the company has been the primary organisation function for culture, however companies are inventions of the nation state and are therefore tied to geographic boundaries. Their effectiveness is not in dispute, but their ability to maintain coherence, alignment and knowledge transfer at ever greater scales is. 

### Blockchain based organisations

Blockchain based systems are the most recent addition to humankinds attempts to scale collective intelligence - aka creativity. 

At the core of these systems are _triple entry accounting systems_ that incentivise participants to append, verify and timestamp a shared ledger.  
   
Network security guarantees are the core value proposition of public blockchains, however this primary (and necessary) design focus on _security_ leads to downstream issues when it comes to coordinating contributors within on-chain based organisations (aka DAOs) and the ability to advance collective intelligence. 

Fungible treasuries denominated in the native token of a network appear wealthy in fiat terms ([$24 billion and counting](https://deepdao.io/organizations)), however as projects are funded, teams liquidate tokens into working capital which creates natural sell pressure. 

Without sustained _network adoption_ and _meaningful value accrual_, networks will be repriced, slowly, then suddenly. 

A chicken and egg situation results - the networks **must spend** to drive adoption, but must also contend with a **gradually diminishing token price** in the absence of new demand drivers for their _core value proposition_. 

### Kusama, Kabocha and the separation of church and state 

[Kusama](https://kusama.network) core value proposition is **security-as-a-service** to independent, but interoperable parachains, who pay for this service in KSM. This separation of church and state, allows the networks to focus on their own specific creative context, whilst maintaining communication across a wider ecosystem in a trust-less manner. 

[Kabocha](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/introducing-kabocha-an-experimental-kusama-parachain-incubated-by-the-edgeware-community/327) is a Kusama blockchain bootstrapped via a series of [on-chain proposals](https://gov.edgewa.re/discussions/Kabocha) by a diverse set of contributors.

It has a broad and fair distribution based on a snapshot of [Edgeware](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/re-introducing-edgeware-substrates-most-chaotic-governance-experiment-and-second-oldest-mainnet/500). 

It has no lead team, legal entity and its token is transferable but **unlisted**.

Without the need to bootstrap security, nor deliver fast returns to investors, Kabocha has no short-term listing imperative. Without the distraction of 24/7 speculation on the value of the token, the network is better able to focus on establishing a more experimental and optmistic _creative culture_ that can drive direct participation, collaboration and ultimately drive sustainable **on-chain adoption**. 

### Kabocha network logic  

Existing 

Non-Fungible Treasury 

Aside from a small _maintainance treasury_, Kabocha does not have a **fungible treasury** as has been the standard with DAOs to date. Instead it will soon institute a 








Instead the network only mints new tokens when a proposal is approved 

Those proposing projects assign genesis rights
